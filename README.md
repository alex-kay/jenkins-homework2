## Second homework for Jenkins

* ~~Setup system messgae~~
* ~~setup global admin email address~~
* ~~setup smtp server~~
* ~~setup slack~~
* ~~setup github~~
* ~~Create three folders `/folder1`, `/folder1/folder2` and `folder3`~~
* ~~for `folder1` configure your shared library~~
* ~~create credentials `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`~~
* create group and role `poweruser` and assing it to `folder1`
* inside folder3 create test-job with build permissions for `poweruser`

### My steps

* created a startup shell script for my Jenkins VM that installs Jenkins and creates a hook script in `init.groovy.d` folder.
* First task done; the script changes system message
